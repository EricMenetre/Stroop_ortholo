Still nowadays it remains unclear which processees of the language production and comprehension models are under attentional control.

Here we are interested to know if the encoding of the orthographic length is under attentional control. To investigate this questions, we asked subjects to name in which color rows of X were displayed. The number of Xs can either match the number of letters of the color word to name or can be different (for long color names less Xs than the number of letters in the color name, and the opposite for short color names).

Preliminary results show a tendency favoring the hypothesis. Indeed, congruent items are faster to name compared to incongruent ones.

For now, only 13 subjects were recruited. Power analysis wil have to be ran on these data to estimate a sufficient N to reach a power of 80% with an alpha = 0.05

## To do:

- Run the power analysis
- Create an intermediate report on the preliminary result
- If everything goes well, recruit more subjects and test the hypothesis on a sample large enough to satisfy the recommendations of the power analysis.
